  <h1> My Statement</h1>
  <p>Coming from a fine arts background, my attention to detail and  determination are traits I carry into every aspect of my life, art, relationships, work,  etc. Throughout my short time at SJSU so far I have brought these traits into each of  my classes as being a fearless member of the discussion, no matter the subject.  Making the transition to digital media art was an exciting move. I’ve since learned of  my continuous, and surprising, joy of web design and coding and imagining the  seemingly endless possibilities of digital work.</p>
<p>Throughout my future career I hope to continue to create pieces of  importance to our society. To bring light to ongoing issues and be apart of the  discussion to help solve them. I believe there’s a lot that can be fixed by artworks  and designs shared digitally and I look forward to every new piece.
</p>

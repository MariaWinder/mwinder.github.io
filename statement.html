  <h1> My Statement</h1>
  <p> Throughout this body of work I explored a multitude of ideas. Including those around America’s capitalist society, how music can immerse its listener, and my early experiences with the internet. Finally, as a resident in northern California, the impact of recent wildfires on the land and people who live in the surrounding areas.
</p>
<p> This collection of videos and net art pieces were made over the past four months. For these works, I experimented with new forms of media and techniques. Filming and editing videos was a foreign task until tackling these projects, but I carried the same principles of dedication as I would with a familiar material. The net art websites have been made to test the viewer’s patients and navigation skills with only having one route and a definite end.
</p>

    <h3 class="iframe">MADE IN (NOT YOUR COUNTRY), digital video, 2018</h3>
    <p class="iframe">This piece is a critique on consumerism and production in the United States. I see this being a YouTube video. It's made to be watched on an individual basis to reflect upon own personal habits of consumerism, self indulgence, and awareness.</p>

    <h3 class="iframe">"SupercaliWorld", digital video, 2018</h3>
    <p class="iframe">Using remixed music, quick cuts, and bright colors, I created an immersive video experience into the childish world of Mary Poppins. My interpretation experiments with the audible excitement throughout "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" song and portrays that with the video montage. Small booths have been built to fully submerge the viewer into this piece both visually and audibly. </p>

    <h3>Watch the Yellow Go By, netart, 2018</h3>
    <p>In this netart project, I am exploring my early internet memory in which I watched my two older sisters play an online car game, titled "On The Run". It featured paved roads, a yellow car, cops, and damage on the driver. Each of these features is represented with a page. This website does have a start and finish as you move throughout the pages. It ends with the video on the final page with nothing else to click on.</p>

    <h3>Smoke, netart, 2018</h3>
    <p>Within this project I indirectly guide the viewer through a series of web pages with both educational and emotional content about the recent fires in Northern California. My main design choice for this was to make it easily digestible and simple to navigate from page to page with only having one option to click the small icons on the top of each page. It combines my own photography and footage as well as other pieces I found. The video is made on the informative side while at the same time not unloading a bunch of facts on the viewer being silent and minimal in description.</p>
